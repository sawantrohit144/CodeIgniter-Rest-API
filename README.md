# CodeIgniter 4 Rest API

This project is a simple REST API developed using CodeIgniter 4, a lightweight PHP framework known for its high performance and scalability. The API is designed to handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications requiring a RESTful service. Leveraging CodeIgniter's routing and model handling, the API efficiently manages data interactions and returns responses in JSON format for easy integration with front-end applications. Additionally, the API follows REST principles, ensuring consistency and scalability, and includes features such as input validation and error handling to improve data integrity and user experience.
